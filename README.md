# Process Monitor Service (Bash Implementation)

## Overview
This service monitors processes by checking their status in a MySQL database and automatically restarts them when they enter an alarm state. Designed specifically for RedHat Linux environments, it provides robust process monitoring and management capabilities with circuit breaker pattern implementation to prevent cascading failures.

```bash
# Verifică drepturile de execuție
chmod +x monitor_service.sh

# Rulează scriptul cu debugging
bash -x ./monitor_service.sh
```

```bash
chmod 644 config.ini
```
## Core Functionality
1. **Database Monitoring**
   - Continuously monitors MySQL database for processes in alarm state
   - Tracks process status through STATUS_PROCESS and PROCESE tables
   - Uses efficient SQL queries with JOIN operations

2. **Process Management**
   - Primary method: systemd service management via `systemctl`
   - Fallback method: direct process management using `pkill` and process restart
   - Intelligent handling of both service and standalone processes
   - Health checks after restarts to verify successful recovery

3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Prevents continuous restart attempts of failing processes
   - Configurable failure thresholds and reset times
   - Automatic circuit reset after cooling period

4. **Logging System**
   - Comprehensive logging to both file (`/var/log/monitor_service.log`) and syslog
   - Detailed timestamp and log level information
   - Process restart attempts and outcomes tracking
   - Automatic log rotation based on file size
   - Configurable number of log files to keep

## Dependencies
- MySQL Client (`mysql-client` package)
- Bash 4.0 or higher (for associative arrays)
- systemd (for service management)
- Standard Linux utilities (`awk`, `date`, `pkill`)

## Configuration
The service uses `config.ini` with the following sections:

```ini
[database]
host = localhost
user = root
password = your_password
database = v_process_monitor

[monitor]
check_interval = 300        # Check interval in seconds
max_restart_failures = 3    # Maximum restart attempts before circuit breaker opens
circuit_reset_time = 1800   # Time in seconds before circuit breaker resets

[logging]
max_log_size = 5120         # Maximum log file size in KB before rotation (5MB)
log_files_to_keep = 5       # Number of rotated log files to keep

[process.example]
restart_strategy = service  # Strategy: service, process, or auto
pre_restart_command = /path/to/validation/script  # Command to run before restart
health_check_command = systemctl is-active example  # Command to verify successful restart
health_check_timeout = 10   # Maximum time in seconds to wait for health check to pass
restart_delay = 5           # Delay between restart attempts
max_attempts = 2            # Maximum number of restart attempts per cycle
```

### Health Check Configuration
Each process can have a custom health check command that verifies if the process is running correctly after a restart:

- **health_check_command**: Command to run to verify process health (returns 0 for success)
- **health_check_timeout**: Maximum time in seconds to wait for the health check to pass

For the default section, you can use `%s` as a placeholder for the process name:
```ini
[process.default]
health_check_command = pgrep %s  # Will be replaced with actual process name
health_check_timeout = 5
```

## Installation

1. **Create Service Directory:**
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/monitor_service
```

2. **Copy Files:**
```bash
sudo cp monitor_service.sh config.ini /opt/monitor_service/
sudo chmod +x /opt/monitor_service/monitor_service.sh
```

3. **Install Service:**
```bash
sudo cp monitor_service.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable monitor_service
sudo systemctl start monitor_service
```

## Service Management

- **Start Service:**
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start monitor_service
  ```

- **Check Status:**
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status monitor_service
  ```

- **View Logs:**
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -u monitor_service -f
  ```

- **Stop Service:**
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop monitor_service
  ```

## Database Schema Requirements

### Table: STATUS_PROCESS
```sql
CREATE TABLE STATUS_PROCESS (
    process_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    alarma TINYINT,
    sound TINYINT,
    notes TEXT
);
```

### Table: PROCESE
```sql
CREATE TABLE PROCESE (
    process_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    process_name VARCHAR(255)
);
```
